# 🏆 Tic-Tac-Toe (Java Console Version)

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java, playable in the console. This is my first little project as a first-year software development college student. The game supports two players and detects wins, draws, and invalid moves.

## 📌 Features

✅ 2-player turn-based gameplay  
✅ Win condition detection (rows, columns, diagonals)  
✅ Input validation (prevents overwriting moves)  
✅ Simple and easy-to-read board display  

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed (`java -version` to check).
2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/darrenMCodes/tic-tac-toe-java.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```sh
    cd tic-tac-toe-java
    ```
4. Compile and run the program:
    ```sh
    javac Jlab84.java
    java Jlab84
    ```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

✅ AI opponent (random or minimax strategy)  
✅ GUI version with JavaFX
